Example 6 - Parallel Arrays in Js


Background:
The purpose of this code is to provide you hands-on experience creating and manipulating parallel arrays.

Preamble:
Lee keeps records of his customers in parallel arrays. Many customers contract him for lawn
service, tree trimming, pest control and so on. He invoices his customers monthly. Lee wants
to be able to access a customer overview.
In some situations, he may want an alphabetical list of customers along with the information
in the other arrays. In other instances, he may want to see an accounts receivable report.
Alternatively, he may want to see which customer accounts are past due.
While Lee keeps other information about each client, for this project we will focus on three
arrays only: one that holds the customers names, one that holds the recurring charges for
each customer, and one that holds past due amounts.

Tasks:
1. JavaScript - Sorting Parallel Arrays
Use the data contained in the external JavaScript file LeeCustomersData.js to create
a web page that allows Lee to sort the arrays by any of the following methods:

* Alphabetic order by family name 
* Amount of recurring monthly charges in ascending or descending order 
* Past due amounts in ascending or descending order 

2. HTML Content - Tables 
The result of performing any particular sort should be displayed in tabular form.
